# What is the Dynamic Fire and Fuels Extensions?

The Dynamic Fire System simulates fire ignition, initiation, spread, and damage. Fire ignition and initiation follow Yang et al. 2004. Fire spread rates uses the equations from the Canadian Forest Fire Behavior Prediction System (Forestry Canada Fire Danger Group 1992) and are dependent upon fuel type, weather, and topography. Weather data are input as comma-separated text files containing data compiled directly from weather stations. Actual spread across the landscape follows the elliptical algorithms from Mark Finney, similar to those found in FARSITE. The extension has the flexibility to accommodate fuel types from throughout the world. Mortality from fires generally follows the behavior of previous LANDIS fire extensions.

The Dynamic Fire System extension is used in conjunction with the Biomass Fuels extension. The fuel types should match the fuel types created in the Dynamic Fire System extension. Prescriptions from the Harvest extension and mortality from the BDA extension can optionally cause fuel types to change.
